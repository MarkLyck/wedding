    "how_we_met_description": "It all started when Grace was running late for our bus tour to El Peñón de Guatapé, luckily for her the bus driver was feeling generous that day and decided to wait for our straggling passenger. As we climbed the 649 steps to the top, Mark struck up a conversation and found that they had a lot in common. At the top, both out of breath we bonded over an overpriced fruit popsicle as we admired the breathtaking views of the surrounding lakes. Afterwards we visited a small margarita bar at a local town and made some new friends.",

    "moved_to_new_york_description": "After our trip to South America, Grace moved to New York City to begin her residency in pediatric dentistry. Mark continued his travels but they kept in touch and he visited her in New York. Oliver who is Grace’s first love met Mark and gave her the letter of approval. Mark agreed to be her second love and Mark and Oliver were inseparable ever since. Eventually Mark moved to Brooklyn where they fell in love while exploring the city, trying new restaurants, seeing Broadway shows and sharing (too) many bubble teas. Mark and Grace knew that they were meant to be together.",

    "got_engaged_description": "In October we made a trip to the Dominican Republic. On the first morning, Mark woke Grace up at 5:55am, eager to start the day. Grace still in a sleepy daze was not at all amused! She refused to get out of bed and snoozed multiple times. But Mark had a surprise in store for her. He took her to Altos de Chavón, a beautiful Mediterranean-style town where they met with a photographer for a “casual photoshoot” and Mark proposed to her in the picturesque setting. Grace was overjoyed and said yes! She wished she had worn better shoes that day. They celebrated with a romantic private dinner on the beach and a week of fun exploring, and Grace was relieved she wouldn’t have to wake up at the crack of dawn again anytime soon.",
